### Tuple

1. done one problem - [Sum of Vowels](exercises/1-sum-of-v0w3ls.py)

- tuples are just like lists, 
- but you cannot modify their values. 
- the initial values are the values that will stay for the rest of the program. 
 
:chart: An example where **tuples** are useful is when your program needs to store the names of the months of the year

**Example:**
```python
monthsOfYear = ("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
```

:chart: You access the individual values of a tuple using their indexes, just like with a list.

Hence, 

    `monthsOfYear[0] = "Jan", monthsOfYear[-1] = "Dec"`
