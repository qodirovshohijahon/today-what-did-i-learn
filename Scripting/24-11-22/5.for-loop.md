We can also display the index of the members in the list. To do that, we use the **enumerate()** function


```python
for index, myPets in enumerate(pets):
    print (index, myPets)
```

``This will give us the output``
```python
    0 cats
    1 dogs
    2 rabbits
    3 hamster
```

### Looping through a sequence of numbers
- to loop through a sequence of numbers, the built-in `range()` function comes in handy. 
- the `range()` function generates a list of numbers and has the syntax `range(start, end, step)`
- `if` start is not given, the numbers generated will start from zero.

**For instance,**
```python
    range(5) will generate the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    range(3, 10) will generate [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    range(4, 10, 2) will generate [4, 6, 8]
```
