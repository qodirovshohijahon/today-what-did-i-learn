### Formatting Strings using the format() method

- In addition to using the **%** operator to format strings, 
- Python also provides us with the `format()` method to format strings.

The syntax is

`"string to be formatted".format(values or variables to be inserted into string, separated by commas)`


```python
message = 'The price of this {0:s} laptop is {1:d} USD and the exchange rate is {2:4.2f} USD to 1 EUR'.format('Apple', 1299, 1.235235245)
```

- inside the **curly bracket**, we first write the **position of the parameter** to use,followed by a colon. 
- after the colon, we write the formatter. 
- there should not be any spaces within the curly brackets

- when we write `{0:s}`, we are asking the interpreter to replace `{0:s}` with the parameter in position 0 and that it is a string (because the formatter is `s`)
- when we write `{1:d}`, we are referring to the parameter in position `1`, which is an integer (formatter is `d`)



When we write **{2:4.2f}**, we are referring to the parameter in position **2**, which is a float and we want it to be formatted with **2 decimal** places and a total length of **4** (formatter is **4.2f**).
