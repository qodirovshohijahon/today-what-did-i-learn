- :heavy_check_mark:  This gives you greater control over how you want your string to be displayed and stored.

- :heavy_minus_sign: First we write the string to be

- :heavy_minus_sign: Next we write the % symbol. 
- :heavy_minus_sign: Finally, we have a
pair of round brackets ( ) within which we write the values or
