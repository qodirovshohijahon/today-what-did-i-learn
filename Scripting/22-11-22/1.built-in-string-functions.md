### Formatting Strings using the % Operator

- :heavy_check_mark: Strings can also be formatted using the % operator. 
- :heavy_check_mark:  This gives you greater control over how you want your string to be displayed and stored.

The syntax for using the **%** operator is 

`"string to be formatted" %(values or variables to be inserted into string, separated by commas)`

- :heavy_minus_sign: There are three parts to this syntax. 
- :heavy_minus_sign: First we write the string to be
formatted in quotes.
- :heavy_minus_sign: Next we write the % symbol. 
- :heavy_minus_sign: Finally, we have a
pair of round brackets ( ) within which we write the values or
variables to be inserted into the string. 

This round brackets with values inside is actually known as a tuple


**example one**

```python
# simple message that formatted using string built-in funct
brand = 'Apple'
exchangeRate = 1.235235245

message = 'The price of this %s laptop is %d USD
and the exchange rate is %4.2f USD to 1 EUR' %
(brand, 1299, exchangeRate)
print (message)
```
