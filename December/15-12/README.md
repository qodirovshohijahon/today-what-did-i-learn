### TI - preparation

**1. Explain the relation between availability region and zone?**
- the distinct geographical areas are referred to as availability regions. 
- **for example** - `Asia South` (Chennai) and `US West 1` ( North Washington). 
- **however**, the sites included under these regions are called availability zones.

Usually, only isolated regions are included, capable of replicating themselves as per requirement. 

**2. List some connection issues that can be faced while connecting to an EC2 instance?**
- the connection issues which you might face while connecting to the EC2 instance are 
  - **Host key missing**
  - **Connection timeout** 
  - **User key unrecognized**
  - **Server refusing key**

**3. What is the way to recover a lost EC2 instance?**
- the root volume of the instance has to be detached
- by modifying the configuration file
- by restarting the original instance
- by attaching importance to a temporary instance
