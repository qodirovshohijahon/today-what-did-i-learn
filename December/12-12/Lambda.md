AWS Lambda is 
- a serverless,
- event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. 


You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.


**AWS Lambda** is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
 
**Lambda** runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including 
 - server and operating system maintenance, 
 - capacity provisioning 
 - automatic scaling, and logging



**When to use Lambda**

- **File processing:** 
  - use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to trigger Lambda data processing in real time after an upload.

- **Stream processing:** 
  - use Lambda and Amazon Kinesis to process real-time streaming data for application activity tracking, 
    - transaction order processing,
    - clickstream analysis, 
    - data cleansing, 
    - log filtering, 
    - indexing, 
    - social media analysis, 
    - Internet of Things (IoT) device data telemetry, 
    - metering.

- **Web applications:** 
  - combine Lambda with other AWS services to build powerful web applications that automatically scale up and down and run in a highly available configuration across multiple data centers.

- **IoT backends:** 
  - build serverless backends using Lambda to handle web, 
    - mobile, 
    - IoT, 
    - third-party API requests.

- **Mobile backends:** 
  - build backends using Lambda and Amazon API Gateway to authenticate and process API requests. 
  - Use AWS Amplify to easily integrate your backend with your iOS, Android, Web, and React Native frontends.
