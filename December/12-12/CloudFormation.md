**:one: CloudFormation** 
- is a tool from Amazon Web Services that allows you to create templates for describing and provisioning AWS resources. 
- with CloudFormation, you can define your AWS infrastructure in a template file, and then use that template to create and provision AWS resources automatically.


**:two: Stacks**
- a stack is a collection of resources that are created and managed as a unit by CloudFormation. 
- a stack can contain any number of resources, and you can create as many stacks as you like.


**:three: What are some ways to update or edit a running stack without terminating it?**
- one way to update a running stack is to use the UpdateStack API call. 
- this will allow you to update the template and/or parameters for an existing stack. 
- another way to update a running stack is to use the CloudFormation console. 
- from the console, you can select the stack you want to update, make your changes, and then select “Update Stack”.
