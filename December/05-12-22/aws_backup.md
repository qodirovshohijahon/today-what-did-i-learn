### What is AWS Backup?
- AWS Backup is a fully-managed service that makes it easy to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services, in **the cloud**, **and on premises**. 
- using this service, you can configure **backup policies** and **monitor activity** for your AWS resources in one place. 
- It allows you to 
  - **automate** and **consolidate** backup tasks that were previously performed service-by-service, 
  - **removes** the need to create custom scripts and manual processes. 
  - with a few clicks in the AWS Backup console, you can automate your data protection policies and schedules.
