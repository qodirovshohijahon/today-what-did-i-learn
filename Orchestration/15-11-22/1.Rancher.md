**Rancher** provides a centralized hub for managing Kubernetes clusters across 
- cloud service providers, 
- data centers,
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 

This allows organizations to standardize 
- their Kubernetes version, 
- access control, 
- deployment,
- lifecycles to simplify operations work.

In this lab, we will go through the process of setting up a Rancher instance on an EC2 instance. We will go through the process of configuring Rancher to create an EKS cluster for us in our lab environment. Finally, we will install K3s, a lightweight, single-node Kubernetes distribution, on another EC2 instance and go through the process of importing that cluster into Rancher for central management. This will help you become familiar with how to use Rancher to create new Kubernetes clusters, as well as importing existing clusters hands-on.
