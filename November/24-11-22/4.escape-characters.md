### Escape Characters

- sometimes we may need to print some special `“unprintable”` characters such as a tab or a newline. 
- in this case, you need to use the `\ (backslash)` character to escape characters that otherwise have a different meaning.



- for instance to print a tab, we type the backslash character before the letter **t**, 
- like this: **\t**. 
- without the `\` character, the letter **t** will be printed. With it, a tab is printed. 
- hence, if you type `print(‘Hello\tWorld’)`, you’ll get **Hello  World**
