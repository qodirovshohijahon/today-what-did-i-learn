### Print()

- the `print()` function is used to display information to users. 
- tt accepts zero or more expressions as parameters, separated by commas


```python
    print ("Hello World, my name is", myName, "and Iam", myAge, "years old.")
```

- the first is the string `”Hello World, my name is”`
- the next is the variable myName declared using the input function earlier.
- next is the string `“and I am”`, followed by the variable myAge and finally the string `“years old.”`

- to achieve the same output as the first print statement above, we can write
```python
    print("Hello World, my name is %s and I am %s years old." %(myName, myAge))
```
- finally, to print the same statement using the **format()** method, 
- we write 
```python
    print(“Hello World, my name is {} and I am {} years old”.format(myName, myAge))
```
