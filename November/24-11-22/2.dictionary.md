### Dictionary

- dictionary is a collection of related data PAIRS. 
- for instance, if we want to store the **username** and **age** of **5 users**, we can store them in a dictionary

**Example:**
```python
    userNameAndAge = {"Peter":38, "John":51, "Alex":13, "Alvin":"Not Available"}
```
- you can also declare a dictionary using the dict( ) method. 
- to declare the userNameAndAge dictionary above, you write
```python
    userNameAndAge = dict(Peter = 38, John = 51, Alex = 13, Alvin = "Not Available")
```


- to access individual items in the dictionary, we use the **dictionary key**, 
- which is the **first value** in the `{dictionary key : data}` pair.
- for instance, to get **John’s age**, you write `userNameAndAge["John"]`. You’ll get the value 51


:heavy_plus_sign:
- to modify items in a dictionary, we write `dictionaryName[dictionary key of item to be modified] = new data`. 
- for instance, to modify the `"John":51` pair, we write `userNameAndAge["John"] = 21`. 
- our dictionary now becomes `userNameAndAge = {"Peter":38, "John":21, "Alex":13, "Alvin":"Not Available"}`

:heavy_minus_sign:
- to remove items from a dictionary, we write `del dictionaryName[dictionary key]`. 
- for instance, to remove the `"Alex":13` pair, we write `del userNameAndAge["Alex"]`.
- our dictionary now becomes `userNameAndAge = {"Peter":38, "John":21, "Alvin":"Not Available", "Joe":40}`
